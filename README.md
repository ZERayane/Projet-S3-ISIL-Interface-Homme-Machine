## Getting Started

This project is a small Swing-based Java application that uses JDBC to connect to MySQL. The repository now includes a Gradle build and Flyway migrations so other developers can clone and run the app with minimal setup.

What changed for sharing on GitHub:
- Added `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` so dependencies (MySQL driver, Flyway) are managed automatically.
- Added a Flyway migration `src/resources/db/migration/V1__create_schema.sql` containing the CREATE TABLE statements.
- Added `src/resources/app.properties.example` — copy this to `src/resources/app.properties` and fill in your DB credentials.
- Updated `shop.Main` to attempt to run Flyway migrations at startup (if Flyway is present on the runtime classpath).

## Quick steps for a teammate who clones this repo

1) Copy the example properties and update credentials

```powershell
Copy-Item src\resources\app.properties.example src\resources\app.properties
# Then edit src\resources\app.properties and set db.username/db.password as needed
```

2) Build (Gradle will download dependencies including the MySQL driver and Flyway):

```powershell
gradle clean shadowJar
```

3) Run migrations + start the app

Option A — run with Gradle (recommended during development):

```powershell
gradle runApp
```

Option B — run the fat JAR created by the Shadow plugin (recommended for distribution):

```powershell
java -jar build\libs\electronics-shop-all-0.1.0.jar
```

## Notes about migrations and DB setup

- The project includes Flyway migrations under `src/resources/db/migration`. Flyway will run automatically when you build/run the app with Gradle or when you run the fat JAR produced by `shadowJar` (because Flyway is on the classpath).
- If you prefer to run the SQL manually (phpMyAdmin or mysql CLI), the migration file `V1__create_schema.sql` is plain SQL and can be applied directly.

Manual SQL example (mysql CLI):

```powershell
# create database if needed
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS electronics_shop CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

# apply migration
mysql -u root -p electronics_shop < src\resources\db\migration\V1__create_schema.sql
```

## Security and best practices

- Do NOT commit `src/resources/app.properties` with real credentials. Use the example file and add your local file to `.gitignore` 
- For production or shared environments, prefer environment variables or a secrets manager rather than a plain properties file.

## Prerequisites (Windows)

You must have a **JDK** installed (Java 11+ recommended) and `JAVA_HOME` set, otherwise `.\gradlew` will fail with:

`ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.`

### 1) Install a JDK
Install one of:
- Temurin (Adoptium) JDK 11/17, or
- Oracle JDK 11/17

### 2) Set JAVA_HOME + PATH
Example (PowerShell, adjust path to your installed JDK):

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JAVA_HOME","C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.x.x-hotspot","User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path",$env:Path + ";$([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('JAVA_HOME','User'))\bin","User")
```

Close/reopen the terminal, then verify:

```powershell
java -version
```

Then run:

```powershell
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\Electronics-shop-swing-project
.\gradlew runApp
```
